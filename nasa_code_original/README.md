# Centrifugal compressor code

This is the original version of the code that was translated from Fortan to Python by Mitchell Lowe (Lowe, Mitchell (2016-08-21). Design of a load dissipation device for a 100 kW supercritical CO2 turbine, https://doi.org/10.14264/uql.2017.244)
Minor changes have been done to make the code run.
