# Centrifugal compressor code

This is the original version of the code that was translated from Fortan to Python by Mitchell Lowe. Minor changes have been done to make the code run.

Centrifugal compressor code developed by NASA (https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-17450-1) and translated from Fortran to Python by Mitchell Lowe (Lowe, Mitchell (2016-08-21). Design of a load dissipation device for a 100 kW supercritical CO2 turbine, https://doi.org/10.14264/uql.2017.244).

The code has been further developed by a summer intern at SINTEF Energy Research in 2024.
