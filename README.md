The files contained in this branch was developed with a basis of the nasa code referenced below.This code was then translated from fortran to python by Mitchel Lowe.

code developed by NASA: (https://software.nasa.gov/software/LEW-17450-1 & https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19740001912, 1973) and translated to Python by Mitchell Lowe (https://doi.org/10.14264/uql.2017.244, 2016).

The code was developed as a part of a summer internship at SINTEF Energy Research the summer of 2024. The main objective of the work was to develop code that could determine some design parameters and performance of a hydrogen compressor.
